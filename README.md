## Java Script Coding Quiz!

### About:

#### This is a coding quiz that was created using Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Most of the work was completed using DOM manipulation. 

#### The quiz is designed to ask questions and subtract time when a question is answered wrong. Alot of time and effort went into this, alot of testing and trying different code. Alot worked and alot didn't. 

#### In the end we have a quiz that a student may take, the quiz gives them the option to see past scores or start the quiz right away. The quiz asks multiple choice questions and then gives you a score at the end. You can save that score and enter your initials with it. The user is also able to go in and see the past scores without taking the quiz, they may also clear the existing scores if they would like.
